## Software Engineering Projects!
**[AI-Assisted Recipe Builder](https://github.com/atteap/CSC395_Team1.git)**:
A web application that allows users to generate 
AI-assisted recipes using company-specified ingredients. I 
made a few implementations to the flask, but mainly focused 
on the Frontend UI. Built with Python, CSS, JavaScript, 
HTML, and Dockerfile.

## Large-Scale Programming Projects!
**[Stock Market Data Application](https://github.com/Muy-Fresco/labproject2.git)**:
A Java program designed to handle stock market data. It's uses JSON to process data from 
the APIs, and uses other applications such as JUNit for unit tests, Polygon API to fetch 
stock market data, and Maven for handling dependencies.

## Web Programming Projects!
**[Bakery Website](https://github.com/Muy-Fresco/Lab5CSS.git)**:
This project uses HTML and CSS to create a simple webpage for a bakery.
